• Unlimited flexibility: Use any OpenAI-compatible endpoint or service
• Cost optimization: Choose providers with competitive pricing or deploy models on your own infrastructure
• Vendor independence: Avoid lock-in with ability to switch between providers and models seamlessly
• Custom fine-tuning: Deploy specialized models trained on your security testing scenarios

Best for: Teams with specific model requirements, cost optimization needs, or existing LLM infrastructure
LiteLLM Integration: Set LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER to match your provider name (e.g., "openrouter", "moonshot") to use the same config files with both direct API access and LiteLLM proxy
Examples available: Pre-configured setups for major providers in /opt/pentagi/conf/ directory inside the container`

Performance Considerations:
• Reasoning models provide step-by-step analysis but are slower and more expensive
• Standard models offer faster responses suitable for high-frequency agent interactions

• Poor conversation flow: Increase context retention for quality
• Different model types: Short-context vs long-context model tuning

General Summarization: Maximum cost control and precision tuning for research/analysis tasks
Assistant Summarization: Optimal conversation quality with intelligent context management for interactive sessions

Adjustments by model type:
• Short context (≤16K): Recent Sections=1-2, Section Limit=45KB

• High-frequency chat: Reduce Recent Sections=2 for faster responses

Advanced tuning:
• QA Memory 200KB+ for document analysis conversations

• Keep User Messages uncompressed (SummHumanInQA=false) for better context

Performance optimization:
• Each Recent Section ≈ 9-18KB in assistant mode

• Use Multi-Agent Mode: enable assistant to orchestrate specialized agents for complex tasks

Execution Monitoring (⚠️  BETA):
Automatically invokes adviser (mentor) to analyze execution patterns, detect loops, suggest alternative strategies, and prevent agents from fixating on single approach. Thresholds: consecutive identical calls (default: 5) and total calls (default: 10).

Task Planning (⚠️  BETA):
Generates 3-7 step execution plans before specialist agents begin work. Prevents scope creep and improves success rates. Works best when adviser uses enhanced configuration (stronger model or maximum reasoning mode).

Tool Call Limits (always active):
Hard limits prevent infinite loops: General agents default 100, Limited agents default 20. Works independently from beta features.

OPEN SOURCE MODELS < 32B (Qwen3.5-27B, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-3.1-70B):
✓ ENABLE both beta features - ESSENTIAL for quality results
✓ Testing shows 2x improvement in result quality vs. baseline
✓ Configure adviser with enhanced settings for best performance
✓ Ideal for air-gapped deployments with local LLM inference

Performance: 2-3x increase in tokens/time, 2x improvement in quality for models < 32B.

⚠️  BETA WARNING: Features under active development. Recommended for open source models < 32B despite beta status. For cloud APIs with larger models, keep disabled.

Storage operates via Docker volumes by default, or host directories when Work Directory is specified. Connection settings control the Docker daemon location - local socket for standard setups, or remote TCP with TLS for distributed environments.

Default images serve as fallbacks: general tasks use standard images, while security testing defaults to pentesting-focused containers. Public IP enables reverse shell attacks by providing workers with a reachable address for target callbacks.
