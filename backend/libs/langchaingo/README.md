⚡ Building applications with LLMs through composability, with Go! ⚡

## 🚀 Important Announcement 🚀

> **Starting from release [v0.1.13-update.1](https://github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo/releases/tag/v0.1.13-update.1)**, this fork is now a full-fledged library that **does not require** any `replace` directives in your go.mod file. You can simply add it to your project with:
>
> ```bash
> go get github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo@latest
> ```

## Why this fork?

This fork was created to incorporate functionality from open Pull Requests that haven't been merged into the original repository yet. You can view the list of accepted PRs in our [v0.1.13-update.0 release](https://github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo/releases/tag/v0.1.13-update.0) and in the [main-pull-requests branch](https://github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo/commits/main-pull-requests/).

Additionally, this repository contains custom improvements and enhancements related to langchaingo support, which will be published as releases. The original repository's state can be accessed in the [main branch](https://github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo/tree/main), which will be regularly updated with upstream changes.

This fork is primarily maintained for use in the [PentAGI](https://github.com/vxcontrol/pentagi) project, an autonomous AI Agents system for performing complex penetration testing tasks.

## Branch Structure and Versioning

This repository follows a specific branching strategy to maintain both upstream compatibility and custom enhancements:

### Branch Management

- **main**: Fully synchronized with upstream (`tmc/langchaingo`) using fast-forward merges.
- **main-pull-requests**: Contains useful PRs from upstream that haven't been officially merged. Updated by merging from `main` after synchronization.
- **main-vxcontrol**: Default branch containing all current enhancements including module name changes and stability improvements. Updated by merging from `main-pull-requests`.
- **release/v***: Created from `main-vxcontrol` for each release. These branches are stable to use in production, all tags are linked to these branches.

### Versioning

Release tags follow the format `v0.1.13-update.1`, where:
- `v0.1.13` corresponds to the latest upstream release version
- `-update.1` indicates our increment number (starting at 1 and incrementing with each new release)

Each new release cumulatively includes all changes from previous releases on top of the current upstream state, ensuring that you always get the complete set of enhancements when using a specific tag.

### Dependency Management

**Important**: When using this fork in your projects, always reference **release tags** for stable and predictable dependencies.

```
go get github.com/vxcontrol/langchaingo@v0.1.13-update.1
```

### Branch Visualization

```

                         \       \
  main-pull-requests     G---H---I---J     (merged from main, PRs from upstream)
                              \       \
  main-vxcontrol              K---L---M   (default branch, merged from main-pull-requests)
